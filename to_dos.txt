I'll help you break down the FlavorFi project using the Spoonacular API. Based on the project description and team task distribution, here's a comprehensive implementation plan:
Project Setup and API Integration
1. API Key and Configuration

Sign up for Spoonacular API and obtain an API key
Create a .env file to store the API key securely
Set up API service class for network calls

2. API Endpoints to Utilize
From the Spoonacular documentation, you'll primarily use these endpoints:

/recipes/complexSearch - Main recipe search
/recipes/{id}/information - Get detailed recipe information
/food/ingredients/autocomplete - Ingredient search and suggestions

3. Key Screens and Functionality
A. Onboarding Screen

Create an introductory walkthrough
Explain app features
Allow user to set initial dietary preferences

B. Home Screen

Ingredient-based search bar
Quick filters:

Dietary preferences (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
Meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
Nutritional filters (low-carb, high-protein)



C. Recipe Search Results Screen

Display recipes from API search
Show:

Recipe image
Title
Quick nutritional overview
Cooking time
Dietary tags



D. Recipe Detail Screen

Comprehensive recipe information
Ingredients list
Step-by-step instructions
Full nutritional breakdown
Option to save recipe

E. Profile/Settings Screen
